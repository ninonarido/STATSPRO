Data Scientist Aspirants, Data Analysts, Data Engineers, Database Developers, Statisticians who want to swiftly travel through the journey of machine learning and AI in future. Basics of Python coding is sufficient for this book.

## What technical background is required to get full benefit from this book?
Basic high school/first year college level knowledge of mathematics (functions, matrix, limits, derivatives, integrals)

## What is important to them?
* Understand the basic statistical methods used in data science and predictive analytics and be comfortable with their implementation using Python libraries.
* Explore the (basic) mathematics behind the algorithmic methods which power machine learning and data science pipeline.
* On the programming side, primary goal is to show a quick and easy implementation, focusing on illustrating the associated concept of mathematics/statistics and not a detailed and optimized code.

## Overview
Mathematics is the language of natural laws, as expressed by modern science. Consequently, development of contemporary applied scientific disciplines and technology, particularly computational science, has been reliant on powerful mathematical techniques. Therefore, it is no surprise that almost all the techniques of modern data science, including machine learning, have a deep mathematical underpinning.

Having a solid knowledge of some essential topics of math, is particularly important for beginners and ambitious learners arriving to the domain of data science from other professions - retail, chemical process, electronics and hardware engineering, medicine and health care, business management, and even information technology and services. Although those professions may regularly require working with spreadsheets, performing numerical calculations, and estimating business projections, the math skills required in data science can be significantly and subtly different.

Keeping in mind those requirements, the first part of this book starts with a refresher on fundamental mathematical topics, which are likely to appear in the daily work of any practicing data scientist. Basics of set algebra and discrete math, properties of numbers and series, various algebraic functions, and plotting and visualization techniques are covered in the first few chapters. This is followed by a review of calculus – limits, differentiation, and integrals - and key optimization techniques as applicable to machine learning.

Knowledge of statistics is the most used and valuable technical skill to be a successful data scientist and therefore the second part is dedicated to the statistical methods required in data science projects. It starts with a discussion of various statistical techniques used in typical data science pipeline through case illustration and then goes on to cover essential topics of descriptive and inferential statistics along with probability theory and distributions. Further, it also introduces basics of Bayesian statistics and analysis. 

Next part of the book deals with linear algebra with the focus on basic properties of vectors and matrices, matrix multiplication and linear transformations, solution of the system of linear equation, and various matrix factorization methods. It also touches on the advanced topic of principal component analysis, as an important component of machine learning pipeline.

Last chapter of the book rounds up the mathematical journey by bringing home all these mathematical techniques in the context of various popular machine learning algorithms such as linear and logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machine, and even deep neural networks. 

By the end of the book, you will build a strong foundation of mathematical skills, statistical knowledge, and data computation abilities to pursue a successful career as a highly efficient and impactful data scientist in your chosen profession.
